# mpv_frame_info

Simple Lua script for mpv to display frame info, similar to ffdshow's OSD.
Might be useful in case of e.g. screenshot comparisions.

## Usage

Put `frame_info.lua` to `~/.config/mpv/scripts/` or `~/.mpv/scripts/` directory
to autoload the script or load it manually with `--script=<path>`.

The script is binding itself to `i` (however, not overriding your own bindings)
and can therefore be invoked with this key. You can create different
bindings by adding `<yourkey> script_binding frame_info` to `input.conf`.

Press `i` to toggle info displaying, press `Ctrl+s` to make the screenshot with info. NOTE: script doesn't work correctly with OSC, you need to disable it.
